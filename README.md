# Data-Wrangling-and-Exploration-of-ACT-weather
ACT weather data analysis and data visualization.
Note: The script will set the working directory to the R file which is in the zip file. The script searches for the 
folder data where the R file is extracted. (script and folder with name data which contains all csv inside to be in the 
same folder). 
I have not used relative path as the number of lines of code increases. And also, I have used the code to read all csv 
files from the “data” folder at one go. (which appends data at one go to a single tibble).
